Sphere target strength calculator
=================================

The ''sphereTS'' package calculates the acoustic target strength (TS) of elastic spheres immersed in a fluid. It is intended for calculating the TS of the spheres used for calibrating echosounders used for quantitative estimates of marine organism backscatter.

Details on the algorithms used are available from the About button in the program's GUI.
