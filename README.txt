Sphere target strength calculator
=================================

The sphereTS package calculates the acoustic target strength (TS) of elastic spheres immersed in a fluid. It is intended for calculating the TS of the spheres used for calibrating echosounders used for quantitative estimates of marine organism backscatter.

There are two ways to use this package:
1. Call the functions in the sphereTS.py file from your code and use the results as required
2. Run sphereTSGUI.py and use the GUI to generate sphere TS estimates

Requirements
============
These packages are required for the non-GUI part:

- NumPy
- SciPy
- GSW

and these for the GUI part:

- Matplotlib
- traits
- traitsUI
