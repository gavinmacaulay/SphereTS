<h2>Sphere TS calculator</h2>
<p>This program calculates the TS of acoustic calibration spheres.</p>
    
<p>Developed by Gavin Macaulay.</p>
    
<h3>Instructions</h3>

<li>Set the appropriate sphere and environmental properties
<li>Choose the desired requencies and frequency sweep limits
<li>Click on the <b>Calculate</b> button to produce a plot of the TS values
    
<h3>Methods</h3>

<p>Equations 6-9 of MacLennan (1981) are used to calculate the TS between
the given start and stop frequencies. An averaged 
TS is also calculated via a linear mean over the frequencies within
the given bandwidth.</p>
    
<p>In addition the bandwidth averaged TS at spot frequencies is calculated. 
This is done independently of the frequency sweep.</p>
    
<p>When the <em>Calculate from T,S, and D</em> option is ticked, the water sound 
speed and density are calculated using the <a href="http://www.teos-10.org">TEOS-10</a> formulation.</p>
