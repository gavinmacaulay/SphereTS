<h2>Sphere TS calculator</h2>
<p>This program calculates the target strength (TS) of acoustic calibration spheres.</p>
    
<p>Developed by Gavin Macaulay.</p>
    
<h3>Instructions</h3>

<li>Set the appropriate sphere and environmental properties.
<li>Choose the desired spot frequencies and frequency sweep limits.
<li>Click on the <b>Calculate</b> button to produce a plot of the sphere TS.

<p>The TS will then be calculated over the frequency sweep range and plotted 
in a separate window. Both the averaged and unaveraged TS are plotted. </p>

<p>The TS at the spot frequencies will be shown in
a box in the plot window. The spot frequencies are always averaged. If the averaging 
bandwidth would cause the frequency to be less than zero, it is truncated
at zero and the average TS value is flagged with an asterisk.</p>
    
<h3>Methods</h3>

<p>The sphere target strength is calculated using equations 6-9 of MacLennan (1981) between
the given start and stop frequencies. An averaged 
TS is also calculated via a linear mean over the frequencies within
the given bandwidth. The frequency resolution is set automatically to give a smooth plot in a short computation time.</p>
    
<p>In addition, the bandwidth averaged TS at spot frequencies is calculated. 
This is done independently of the frequency sweep calculation.</p>
    
<p>When the <em>Calculate from T,S, and D</em> option is ticked, the water sound 
speed and density are calculated using the <a href="http://www.teos-10.org">TEOS-10</a> formulation.</p>
